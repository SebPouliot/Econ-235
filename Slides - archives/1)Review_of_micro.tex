\section[Introduction]{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item \emph{Economics} studies the allocation of scarce resources to achieve given ends.
  \item \emph{Microenonomics} studies the behavior of individual units, such as a firm or a consumer, in making themselves as well off as possible given the scarcity of resources.
  \item In contrast, \emph{macroenonomics} focuses on large aggregates such as the GDP, growth, the interest rate, unemployment and inflation.
  \item In this class, we will mostly use microeconomics theory to understand price discovery and what affects prices of agricultural commodities.
  \item Macroeconomic variables will however often play a role in understanding markets.

\begin{frame}{Utility maximization}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item Consumer demand derives from preferences and a budget constraint.
  \item Consumers seek to maximize their utility, which summarizes their preferences, under a budget constraint.
  \item For two goods $x_1$ and $x_2$, the utility maximization program is \[ \max_{x_1,x_2} U(x_1, x_2) \text{ s.t. } Y \ge p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2, \] where $p_1$ is the price of good 1, $p_2$ is the price of good 2 and $Y$ is income.
  \item The solution gives the demand functions $x_1(p_1,p_2,Y)$ and $x_2(p_1,p_2,Y)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Definition}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item The demand is the quantity of a good or service that consumers or firms are willing to buy in function of the price and other factors such as income and the price of other goods.
  \item More generally, we can write the demand function as: \[ Q^d = D(P,P_s,P_c, Y),\] where
    \begin{enumerate}[label=-]
        \item $Q^d$ is the quantity demanded;
        \item $P$ is the price of the good;
        \item $P_s$ is the price of substitute goods;
        \item $P_c$ is the price of complement goods;
        \item $Y$ is income.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Many other variables can enter the demand function, e.g. weather, seasonality,...
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Own price effect}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item The demand slopes down with respect to the price of the good: \[ \frac{\p Q^d}{\p P} = \frac{\p D(P,P_s,P_c, Y)}{\p P} \le 0. \]
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \item This is the law of demand.
  \item A change in the price of a good causes a movement \textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,0.00}{along} the demand curve of that good.
  \item Consumers are willing to buy more if the price is low.
  \item Economists usually plot the inverse demand.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{Elasticity}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item Economists use the concept of elasticity to measure the sensitivity of a change in one variable $Z$ with respect to the change in another variable $X$.
  \item Algebraically, we can write this as \[ \frac{\p Z}{\p X} \frac{X}{Z} = \frac{\% \Delta Z}{\% \Delta X} = \frac{ \Delta Z/Z }{\Delta X/X},\] where $\Delta$ denotes a ``large" change and $\p$ denotes a ``small" change.
  \item An elasticity expresses the percentage change in a variable $Z$ with respect to a one percent change in another variable $X$.
  \item One advantage of elasticity is that it is unitless!
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Own-price elasticity of demand}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item The expression for the own-price elasticity of demand is \[ \eta = \frac{\p D(P,P_s,P_c, Y)}{\p P} \frac{P}{Q^d} = \frac{\% \Delta Q^d}{\% \Delta P} = \frac{ \Delta Q^d/Q^d }{\Delta P/P} .\]
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \item Note that some use $\epsilon$ to denote the elasticity of demand. In this class, we will use $\epsilon$ to denote the elasticity of supply.
  \item As the demand slopes down, the elasticity of demand takes a negative value.

\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Own-price elasticity of demand}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item We say that
    \begin{enumerate}[label=-]
        \item the demand is elastic if $\eta<-1$;
        \item the demand is unit-elastic if $\eta=-1$;
        \item the demand is inelastic if $\eta \in (-1,0)$.
      \end{enumerate}
  \pause
  \item Examples of good with elastic demand: pencil, iphone, broccoli.

\begin{frame}{Example 1: own-price elasticity of demand}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item Suppose that you observed last week that the price of dahu meat was \$8 per pound and that the consumption of dahu meat during that week was 10,000 pounds. Now, you observe this week that the price of dahu meat increased to \$10 per pound and that the consumption decreased to 7,000 pounds. What is the elasticity of the demand for dahu meat?
  \pause
  \item The percentage change in consumption is $(7,000-10,000)/10,000 = -0.3$ or $-30\%$.
  \item The percentage change in the price is $(10-8)/8 = 0.25$ or $25\%$.
  \item The elasticity of demand for dahu meat is $\eta = \frac{-30\%}{25\%} = -1.2$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example 2: own-price elasticity of demand}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item Suppose that you know that the demand function for kumquats in Ames is \[ Q^d = 1000 - 75 P .\] Last week you observed that the price of kumquats was \$5 per pound. What is the elasticity of demand?
  \pause
  \item The quantity demanded of kumquats is $1000 - 75*5 = 625$ pounds.
  \item The partial derivative of the demand function with respect to the price is $\frac{\p Q^d}{\p P} = -75$.
  \item The elasticity of demand for kumquats in Ames is thus \[ \eta = \frac{\p Q^d}{\p P} \frac{P}{Q^d} = -75*\frac{5}{625} = -0.60 .\]

\begin{frame}{What else shifts the demand?}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item It is not only the price of other goods and income that shift the demand.
  \item Other demand shifters include:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=-]
        \item Seasonality (e.g. holidays);
        \item Weather;
        \item Information about the quality of a product (e.g. food scare);
        \item Trends (e.g. fashion);
        \item Age.
      \end{enumerate}
  \item Can compute elasticity with respect to any variable.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Linear demand}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item Economists often use a simple linear functional form for the demand: \[ Q^d = a - b P, \] where $a>0$ and $b>0$ are parameters of the demand function.
  \item The slope of the demand function is $\frac{\p Q^d}{\p P} = -b$.
  \item We can assign values to the demand parameters based on the elasticity of demand (for which it is possible to find an estimate or to guesstimate its value) and the observed values for the price and the quantity.
  \item We can write the elasticity of demand as \[\eta = \frac{\p Q^d}{\p P} \frac{P}{Q^d} = -b \frac{P}{Q^d}.\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Linear demand}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item We can find values for $a$ and $b$ based on observed price and quantity and an estimate of the elasticity of demand.
  \item We can find the values of the parameters of the demand function in two steps:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman{*})]
        \item Find the value of $b$ as \[b = -\eta \frac{Q^d}{P}.\]
        \vspace{-\baselineskip}
        \item Knowing $b$, we find that the value of $a$ is \[ a = Q^d + b P.\]
        \vspace{-\baselineskip}
      \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example: Linear demand}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item Suppose that you observe that the price of dahu meat  was \$8 per pound last week and that the consumption of dahu meat during that week was 10,000. You know from credible estimates of demand that the elasticity for dahu meat is -1.2. Find the values for the parameters in the linear demand function.
  \item Let's proceed in two steps:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman{*})]
        \item Finding the values of $b$: \[b = -\eta \frac{Q^d}{P} = 1.2*\frac{10,000}{8} = 1,500.\]
        \vspace{-\baselineskip}
        \item Finding the value of $a$:  \[ a = 10,000 + 1,500*8 = 22,000.\]
        \vspace{-\baselineskip}
      \end{enumerate}
  \item Thus, we can write the demand as \[ Q^d = 22,000 - 1,500 P.\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Graphing the inverse demand}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item Economists usually graph the price on the vertical axis and the quantity on the horizontal axis.
  \item This means that we must find the inverse of the demand function.
  \item The expression for the inverse demand function is: \[ P = \frac{a}{b} - \frac{1}{b} Q^d.\]
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \item For our example with dahu meat, the inverse demand is: \[ P = \frac{22,000}{1,500} - \frac{1}{1,500} Q^d.\]
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}
\end{enumerate}

A lobby of dahu meat eaters puts pressure on the government who end up lowering the price of dahu meat to \$7 per pound. At a price of \$8 per pound, the weekly production of dahu meat was 10,000 pounds. At a price of \$7 per pound, the production of dahu drops to 9,000 pounds. What is the elasticity of supply for dahu meat?
  \pause
  \item The percentage change in production is $(9,000-10,000)/10,000 = -0.1$ or $-10\%$.
  \item The percentage change in the price is $(7-8)/8 = -0.125$ or $-12.5\%$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item Suppose that the price is lower than the equilibrium price $P^\ast$:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=-]
        \item There is \emph{excess demand} as consumers are willing to more less than what firms are willing to supply at that price.
        \item Some consumers will offer more for the product.
        \item Moving along the demand curve following the increase in price, the quantity demanded must decline.

\begin{frame}{Solving for equilibrium}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item At equilibrium there is no excess supply or no excess demand.
  \item This means that $Q^\ast=Q^s=Q^d$ and that price paid by consumers is the same as the price received by suppliers.
  \item We can use this to solve for the market equilibrium if we know expressions for the demand function and the supply function.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example: solving for equilibrium}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item Suppose that you know that the inverse demand for dahu meat is  \[ P = 100 - 10 Q^d. \]
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \item You also know know that the inverse supply for dahu meat is \[ P = -200 + 50 Q^s.\]

\begin{frame}{Example: solving for equilibrium}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item How to find the market equilibrium?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=-]
        \item We know that at equilibrium that there is only one price and that $Q^\ast=Q^s=Q^d$.
        \item From the expressions for the inverse demand and the inverse supply we can write \[100 - 10 Q^\ast = -200 + 50 Q^\ast. \]
        \vspace{-\baselineskip}
        \item Solving for the quantity, we find that $Q^\ast = 5$.
        \item Using the solution for the quantity in the inverse demand yields $P^\ast = 100- 10*5=50$.
        \item Note that we find the same solution is we instead use the inverse supply: $P^\ast = -200 + 50*5 = 50$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Thus, the market equilibrium is $Q^\ast = 5$ and $P^\ast = 50$.

  \item Find the market equilibrium.

\begin{frame}{Problem 2: solving for equilibrium}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item You observe that the price of maple syrup is \$75 per gallon and that the annual consumption of maple syrup in Ames is 1,000 gallons.
  \item From reliable sources, you know that the elasticity of demand for maple syrup is $\eta = -10$ and the elasticity of supply for maple syrup is $\epsilon = 0.1$.
  \item Find expressions for the linear inverse demand function and for the linear inverse supply.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{In practice, how does it work?}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
  \item For the market to work and reach an equilibrium, buyers and sellers must be informed of the price.
  \item There exist several mechanisms to relay information about prices:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=-]
        \item Marketplaces for \emph{futures} and \emph{options} (e.g. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CEM) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)).
        \item Information about prices are available online or in newspapers.
        \item Auctions.
        \item The USDA through several of its agencies (e.g. ERS, NASS, FAS) report prices for agricultural commodities.
        \item The US government requires mandatory price reporting for several commodities (see for example the \emph{Mandatory Price Reporting Act} of 2010). The objective is to improve transparency and favor competition.
        \item Buyers and sellers are free to search for market opportunities.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Thus, information about prices allow for arbitrage such that markets for agricultural commodities should work well and converge toward the market equilibrium.
  \item It is sometimes impressive to see how fast profit opportunities are exploited thus making the markets converge toward equilibrium very quickly.
  \item Some firms specialize in gathering information (e.g. by estimating yields before everyone else) to profit from arbitrage opportunities.
\end{enumerate}
